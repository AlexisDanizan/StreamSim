<h1>Welcome on StreamSim Web Application</h1>

<div>This application offers the opportunity to select a stream among existing ones. Each stream is defined by a schema and linked to an emission port.
	Users can then emit and listen to synthetic streams. In addition, StreamSim allows to define manually the output rate of a stream during its diffusion.
